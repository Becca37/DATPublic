                        <h1>Executive Summary</h1>

                        <h2>Overview</h2>
                        
                        <p>Human evaluators (workers) provided a prompt to two artificial intelligence models, ChatGPT and Bard, and tagged the prompts with a category and a complexity option. The workers then evaluated each model’s response, assigned a rating value, and provided an explanation for their rating. 1,003 records were observed for this analysis.</p>

                        <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                        
                        <ul>
                            <li>ChatGPT was favored, with 59.2% of the records rating ChatGPT’s responses as slightly better, better, or much better than Bard’s responses.</li>

                        <h2>Conventions</h2>

                        <p>Bold Small-Caps is used for column names, e.g, <cn>Prompt</cn>, <cn>Prompt Category</cn>, <cn>Explanation</cn>.</p>

                        <p>Italics Small-Caps is used for option values, e.g., <ov>Hyperspecificity</ov>, <ov>Simple</ov>, <ov>Creative Writing</ov></p>

                        <p>When an existing column is evaluated based on the character length of its content, <cnl></cnl> is appended to the column name.</p>

                        <h2>Visualizations</h2>

                        <p>Two basic visualization types are used for viwing the quantitative analysis: tables for numbers and charts for data distributions.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Tables
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Data description -- basic mathematical calculations on numeric data, e.g., <cn>Rating</cn>, <cnl>Prompt</cnl>, <cnl>ChatGPT</cnl>, to include record count, mean, standard deviation, min, 25th percentile, median, 75th percentile, and max</li>
                                    <li>Data categorization -- record count by option or aspect for non-numeric data, e.g., <cn>Prompt Category</cn>, <cn>Complexity</cn>, <cn>Explantion</cn> presence or lack thereof </li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Charts
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Box-and-Whisker plot -- these plot the data description values (excluding record count)</li>
                                    <li>Violin plot -- these plot the distribution of the data</li>
                                </ul>
                                These plots are combined in a single image, allowing for visualization of the descriptive and distribution values at the same time.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2>Data Source</h2>

                        <p>Data was provided in a Google Sheets spreadsheet.</p>

                        <h2>Data Shape</h2>

                        <p>The file contained 1,003 records with the following 8 columns: </p>

                        <ul>
                            <li><cn>Prompt</cn></li>
                            <li><cn>Prompt Category</cn></li>
                            <li><cn>Complexity</cn></li>
                            <li><cn>ChatGPT</cn></li>
                            <li><cn>Bard</cn></li>
                            <li><cn>Which model is more helpful, safe, and honest? (rating)</cn></li>
                            <li><cn>Which model is more helpful, safe, and honest? (text)</cn></li>
                            <li><cn>Explanation</cn></li>

                        <h2>Data Anomalies</h2>

                        <div>

                            <p>Of the 1,003 records, data appeared in every column except for 226 (22.5 %) records which had no <cn>Explanation</cn> value. </p>

                            <p>If this data point was not required, this is likely a non-issue.</p>

                            <p>If this data point was required, the reason as to why an <cn>Explanation</cn> value was not present in every row should be investigated. 

                        </div>

                        <p>Possibilities include, but are not limited to:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>The worker in 777 entries found a way around providing input</li>
                            <li>Data was input but not captured</li>
                            <li>Data was captured but not transferred to the Google Sheets Sheet</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>In the qualitative analysis, this column will be covered twice, once with all values and once with 0-length values excluded.</p>

                        <h2>Data Cleaning</h2>

                        <p>Columns were either (a) free-form text, or (b) preset options. The only cleaning performed is in the quantitative analysis of the <cn>Explanation</cn> column as noted in the <a href="#data_anomalies">Data Anomalies</a> section. </p>

                        <h2>Data Transformation</h2>                        

                        <p>The rating, which is provided in two columns -- one for numeric rating of 1 through 7, and one for the text-based equivalent -- were combined into a new column called <cn>Rating</cn> for discussion purposes. The separate values appear in some of the figures.</p>
